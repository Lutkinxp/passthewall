# passthewall
Overview

The "passthewall" script is a command-line tool designed to crack passwords using two primary methods: brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks. It leverages multithreading to enhance performance during brute-force attempts and provides logging for tracking progress and results.

Features

    Brute-Force Attack: Attempts to guess the password by generating all possible combinations of characters up to a specified maximum length.
    Dictionary Attack: Attempts to guess the password using a list of potential passwords from a specified dictionary file.
    Multithreading: Utilizes multiple threads to perform brute-force attacks concurrently, improving efficiency.
    Progress Tracking: Displays the number of attempts made and the time taken to crack the password.
    Timeout Option: Allows the user to set a timeout for the brute-force attack, after which the process will stop if the password has not been cracked.
    Customizable Character Set: Users can specify a custom set of characters to use in the brute-force attack.

Usage

The script is executed from the command line with the following arguments:

    target_password: The password to be cracked.
    max_length: The maximum length of the password to try.
    num_threads: The number of threads to use for the brute-force attack.
    --charset: (Optional) A string of characters to use for brute-forcing. Defaults to letters, digits, and punctuation.
    --dictionary: (Optional) A path to a dictionary file for the dictionary attack.
    --timeout: (Optional) A timeout in seconds for the brute-force attack.


Conclusion

The "passthewall" script is a powerful tool for password recovery, suitable for educational purposes and ethical hacking practices. It demonstrates the use of multithreading and combinatorial generation in Python, making it a valuable resource for learning about password security and cracking techniques.
